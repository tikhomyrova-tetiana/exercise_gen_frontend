## Exercise GEN 🏋️🎲

Exercise GEN is a full stack app with the frontend built in React and a <a href="https://github.com/tikhomyrova-tetiana/exercise_gen_backend">backend</a> that uses NodeJS and Express.


This is a site for a fun and effective way to get a full-body workout at home or in a jym when you feel tired of doing the same exercises and want some variety.
The dice cover various body parts and types of exercises (cardio, back, arms, legs, chest, waist), and determine the number of reps or duration of doing exercise, so you have a lot of possible combinations.
You can generate separate exercises or roll the dice for the entire workout - each die represents a different area of focus: arms, legs, chest and back, waist and number of reps/time. Exercise Gen is guaranteed to keep workouts fresh and exciting. 

Here is a link to the deployed app. You can login with email: test@test.com and password: test1234 if you would like to try out Exercise GEN features.
