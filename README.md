Exercise GEN 🏋️🎲



A fun and effective way to get a full-body workout at home or in jym when you feel when you are tired of doing the same exercises and want some variety.
The dice cover various body parts and types of exercises (cardio, back, arms, legs, chest, waist), and determine the number of reps or duration of doing exercise, so you have a lot of possible combinations.
You can generate separate exercises or roll the dice for the entire workout - each die represents a different area of focus: arms, legs, chest and back, waist and number of reps/time. Exercise Gen is guaranteed to keep workouts fresh and exciting.
